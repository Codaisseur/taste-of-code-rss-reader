# Variables

Any script or program that you write, will need to temporarily store specific bits of information that it needs to do its job. This data is stored into **variables**.

### 🌟 You can think of variables as `named containers or boxes` that store information.

First, you place data into these containers and afterwards you can refer to the data simply by naming the container. In this example, a variable named `sum` is used to store the result of a calculation:

```javascript
var sum = 10 + 5
```

You can also use variables to store a piece of text (or string), like so:

```javascript
var greeting = "Good morning"
```

Or true/false values (or booleans):

```javascript
var buildingRSSReaderAtTOC = true
```

📍 **Important.** Don't forget to type the keyword `var` every time that you define a new variable.





## ✏️ Exercise

> 1. Create a new file `rss.js` under the `toc-rss-reader` folder in Atom.
>
> 2. Visit the site [NEDERLANDSE RSS FEEDS](http://www.nationalemediasite.nl/rss-feeds.php) and select 4 news sites that you want to follow. Find out each of the feed URLs for those sites.
>
> 3. Back in your editor, store each of feed URLS in a variable under the `rss.js` file. This is how an example with NOS feed URL would look like:
>
>   ```javascript
>   var nosUrl = "http://feeds.nos.nl/nosjournaal"
>   ```

## 🎩 Only for Coaches

> During this exercise, you should focus on:
>
> + Helping students to create a new `rss.js` file inside their project in Atom.
> + Guiding students to understand what is a **variable**.
> + Helping students to find out some feed URLs in the NEDERLANDSE RSS FEEDS site and storing them in different variables.

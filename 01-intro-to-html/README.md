# Introduction to HTML

### 🌟 HTML is the language of the web, used for writing web pages.

Any website you ever visited was made with html. The language started off as a pure text based document format, and each new version of HTML is adapted to the new requirements of the web.

Let's look at an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Taste of Code</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Agenda</h1>
    <p>On the menu today:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Structure with HTML</li>
      <li>Styling with CSS</li>
      <li>Happiness with Lunch</li>
    </ul>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's go through the code above **one tag at a time**:

* `DOCTYPE` defines the document type to be HTML
* `<html>` describes an HTML document
* `<head>` provides information about the document
* `<title>` provides a title for the document
* `<body>` describes the visible page content
* `<h1>` describes a heading
* `<p>` describes a paragraph
* `<ul>` describes an unordered list
* `<li>` describes a list item

### 🌟 HTML tags are `keywords` (tag names) surrounded by `angle brackets`. Most HTML tags open and close.

### 🌟 HTML tags can have attributes.

### 🌟 Some HTML tags are self-closing. They don't need a closing tag.

Now it's time for you to practice!






## ✏️ Exercise

> First you need to create a new project project in Atom (your text editor), following these steps:
>
> 1. Create a new folder somewhere in your computer called `toc-rss-reader`. **It is important that you can find this folder later ;-) .**
>
> 2. Open Atom and add a new project folder:

>
> 3. A new window will open, where you can search for the `toc-rss-reader` folder in your computer. Select it and click `Open`:

>
> 4. You should see a sidebar appearing on the left of your editor. Create a new file inside of this folder called `index.html` (you will be writing your first HTML in there):

>
> 5. Write your first HTML inside the `index.html`, applying everything you learnt until now. When you open that file in Chrome, it should render a page similar to this one (feel free to add any of your favorite news sites under the list):

# Introduction to JavaScript

### 🌟 JavaScript is used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting and user-friendly.

Using JavaScript you can access and modify the content and markup used in a web page while it is being viewed in the browser. And pages can also respond to what the user does!

## How JavaScript makes your pages more interactive

There are different ways in which JavaScript can make your web pages more interactive:

1. **Access Content.** Select any element, attribute or text from an HTML page. For example, you can select any elements that have a class attribute with a value of `warning`.

2. **Modify Content.** Add elements, attributes and text to the page, or remove them. For example, you can add a paragraph of text after the first `<h1>` element.

3. **Program Rules or Instructions.** Specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example, you can write a RSS feed script that checks which link a user clicked on and redirect him/her to the article page (which you will learn to do today ;-) ).

4. **React to Events:** Specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred. For example, when a button is pressed or a web page has finished loading.

### 🌟 JavaScript lives already in your browser!

Every browser has its own JavaScript Console where you can start typing JavaScript code right away. It looks like this:
